# Pitch Document

## P5.js Sketch introduction (approx. 150 words)

- Provide an overview of the concept behind your sketch and any insturctions the marker needs to know to run it (thos can be copied form your 'instructions.txt' file)
- Include screenshots from the final sketch showing example visual outputs with a text description explaining what is shown in them.

## Design and Aesthetic Choices (approx. 250 words)

- Explain the design and aesthetic choices you made for the brief.
- Why did you choose the interaction style or game mechanic you did?

## Approach to the Design Process (approx. 350 words)

- You should document your design process showing how you explored alternative design options and creative possibilities
- You should discuss how you have made creative use of your coding skills through the process.

Through CAB301 I learnt about collections of objects. In this sketch there is a physics world which is a collection of rigid bodies. Then through the physics world I can apply gravity to all rigid bodies every frame.

- Remember to capture images of your creative process along the way (sketches, early screenshots, etc.) and include these in the documentation. It helps to communicate to the marker how you enede up at your final outcome.

## Creative Influences (approx. 250 words)

- Include at least three creative influences you have been inspired by to inform the creative outcome. This is to help the marker understand the kind of prototype you are proposing and understand how your proposal relates to other work.

Creative Influence one: Fruit Ninja Kinect Arcade Game Mode.

Roblox Physics Engine.

- This is not simply a list of references or links to online tutorials, etc. You should actually explain why these were an influence for you and why they are relevant to the design.
